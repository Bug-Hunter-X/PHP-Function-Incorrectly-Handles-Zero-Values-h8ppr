This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in PHP: incorrect handling of zero values in a function. The function `foo` is designed to add two numbers. However, it incorrectly handles cases where either input is zero, returning 0 in all such cases. This behavior is unexpected and might lead to unexpected results in various situations. The solution shows the correct implementation.
